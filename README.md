# My_First_App
This is my first ever app that I created (from scratch) using React Native. 

The app called **"Done with it"** is essentially a market place app users can use to sell stuff they don't need anymore - stuff they are "done with".

The code is based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc 


By following this tutorial, I hope to learn the fundamental skills and concepts required in app development as well as build on my passion for creating cool, slick and useful appsðŸ˜Ž
